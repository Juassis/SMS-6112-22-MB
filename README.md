## Introduction

Myotis brandtii are known to have at least a ten-fold longer life expectancy compared to mice of similar body mass, and the highest relative longevity of any mammals. To this end we have collected fresh snap-frozen complete organ systems from these bats during both winter hibernation and summer active period. We thus want to compare gene expressions and control of gene expressions across organs and between these groups. The whole genome is sequenced and available, but the pipeline from sequences to count tables is not established.
